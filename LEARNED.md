Important things I learned:

Auth0:

- Connections in auth0 are caleld **_user stores_**. There are different types of connections in Auth0
- Resource Owner Flow/Grant allows you to obtain an access token by sending your client id, client secret, user email, user password to Auth0.

Supertest:

- By itself, it doesn't provide any testing frameworks like assertions, chainers, ...

Mocha:

- Is a test runner. It can only run tests; it doesn't have any assertion tools
- By itself, it doesn't have any assertions. There are different types of assertions libraries that it integrates with.

17/2:

- Came across a pretty famous github repo that advises against using supertest! It claims that supertest is tied to express, and that coupling is bad :( -- which is a totally fair point. Axios is good enough, although I personally haven't used supertest.

18/2:

- ETags are generated by default in Express.js! It uses the "etag" package, which uses sha1 hashing to generate etags from an arbitrary object.

19/2:

- Buttons that are descendants of a <form> element are implicitly assigned type="submit" ! Needless to say, that caused me a few headaches.
